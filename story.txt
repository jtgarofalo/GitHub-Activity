  Beginning:
  There once was a man named Jim. Jim enjoyed many things, but his favorite thing in the world was singing. 
  Jim would stay up late singing in his room and he'd sing in the shower early the next morning. All Jim
  ever needed in life was to be able to sing. However, one day Jim got a nasty cold that made it so he couldn't
  sing anymore.
  Middle:
  Jim was straight up devastated. He spent all his time singing, and suddenly now he had a lot of free time.
  Jim thought really hard about what he should do. He decided to go see a doctor to see if he could ever 
  restore his singing ability.
  
  End:
  The doctor told Jim he cold only wait for the cold to pass. Jim was disappointed he could not speed up his recovery.
  However, Jim decide to make the best of his situation. Jim started to practice dancing. He had always wanted be able to sing
  and dance, but he had spent too much of his time on singing. When his cold went away Jim was happy with his new ability.
  
  Alternate Ending:
  The doctor didn't show up for his computer science project, so he could not attend to the patient. Jim ended up dying because
  he developed pneumonia, which the doctor would have noticed if he gave him his GitHub username. Instead, the doctor caused
  there to be two endings in this story, as another member had to be added to this project, whose username was supplied.
